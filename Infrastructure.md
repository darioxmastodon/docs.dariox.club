Since we like to be transparent about your information and where it lives, we've made a list of the cloud services we use and what we use them for.

In a perfect would we would be self-hosting everything but currently with my personal situation and the current state of Australian Internet, it is't very feasable to provide a reliable service.

| Service        | Usage                                                           |
