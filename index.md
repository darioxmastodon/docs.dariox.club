## Migrating from Twitter
If you're migrating from twitter, the fediverse may be daunting or confusing at first, especially when finding people that you used to be in contact with.

You can view an extended list of cool mastodon things at [tleb/awesome-mastodon](https://github.com/tleb/awesome-mastodon).

### Services
Here is some services that we endorse for helping your migration to the fediverse
- [Moa Bridge](https://moa.party) A tool to enable cross-posting between the Fediverse and Twitter. Whenever you post on DARiOX it will tweet it, and whenever you send a tweet it will post it to DARiOX.
- [FediFinder](https://finder.dariox.club) ***Hosted by DARiOX*** Find people who you follow on Twitter and follow them on DARiOX. It also can find people who follow you on twitter and their Fediverse handle. If you want to be found, put your handle in your bio or name. Like `@kate@dariox.club` or `https://dariox.club/@kate`
